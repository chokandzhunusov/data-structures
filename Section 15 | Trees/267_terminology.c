Terminology:
    - Tree - collection of Nodes and Edges
    - One node is taken as the “root” node. And divided into “disjoint subsets”, each subset is “tree” or “subtree”
    - n nodes => n-1 edges
    - Siblings - nodes that are bind to same parent
    - Descendants - nodes that are belongs to from up to down
    - Ancestors - nodes that are prev to node till “root”
    - Degree of node - how many direct children node have
    - External/Leaf/Terminal nodes are those who have zero degree
    - Level - the depth from “root” to leaf, starts from 1
    - Height - count edges, starts from 0
    - Forest - collection of trees
    - Binary Tree: Tree of degree 2 (max)
