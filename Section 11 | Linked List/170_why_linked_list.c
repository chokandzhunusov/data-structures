/*
 *  =====================================
 *  Why we need Dynamic Data Sturctures
 *  =====================================
 *  1. Problem with arrays
        - Fixed size created and can not be changed during run time
        - int A[10]
            => can not be >10,
            => also if there are just 2 elements to store causes waste of space
        - creation:
            => in stack: int A[5]
            => in heap(pointer): int *p = new A[5]
 *  2. Difference between Array and LinkedList
        - element space and pointer space together we call as - NODE
