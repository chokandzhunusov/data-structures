/*
 *  ===================================
 *  Comparison of Array with Linked List
 *  ===================================
 *  There are 2 physical data structures, using them we implement other DS:
    1. Array
        - can be stored in Stack as well in Heap
        - fixed size
        - can be accessed in constant time any item
        - faster access 1step if in Stack, 2 steps if in Heap
        - insertion/deletion to left=O(n), to right=O(1)
        - Linear Search algorithm will take O(n)
        - Binary Search algorithm will take O(logn)
        - Most of sorting is designed for this

    2. Linked List
        - in Heap
        - size can be changes
        - have to loop to access item
        - insertion/deletion to left=O(1), to right=O(n)
        - Linear Search algorithm will take O(n)
        - Binary Search algorithm will take O(nlogn)
        - less sorting approaches than array
