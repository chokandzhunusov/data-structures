Special Matrices:
    - square matrices => nxn
    - more zero(0) elements
    - so we can store only non zero elemnts and avoid storing zero(0) elements,
      by that space and computational time can be saved

2. Lower Triangular Matrix
3. Upper Triangular Matrix
4. Symmetric Matrix
5. Tridiagonal Matrix
