=======================
Abstract Data Type:
    - Abstract: hiding internal details
    - Concept is to define the data and operations on data,
      and let it be used as data type by hiding internal details

1. What is ADT
2. List ADT


1.
    - Data Type:
        * Representation of Data
            - Assume that `int` allocates 2 bytes of memory.
              Then first bit will be allocated for `sign`.
              Other 15 bits for number.
        * Operation on Data
            - Operators: +, -, /, *, ++(pre/post), --(pre/post)


2.
    * Data(eg. list => can be represented in program as: array or linked list):
        - space for storing elements
        - capacity
        - size

    * Operations:
        - add(x)
        - remove(x)
        - search(x)
