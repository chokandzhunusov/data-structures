====================================
Static vs Dynamic Memory Allocation
====================================

1. Main memory.
2. How a program use main memory.
3. Static allocation.
4. Dynamic allocation.


1.
    - Memory is divided into blocks of `bytes`.
    - And every byte have it's own address.
    - Addresses are linear.


2.
    - Program loads into main memories `code section`.
    - Whatever vars declared in program they will allocate memory in:
      `stack frame`/`activation record`.


3.
    - Obtaining how much memory is required to run the program
      at compile time(before run time).


4.
    * Heap
        - Can be organized and unorganized.
        - Should be treated as resource.
        - Program will not access directly Heap memory(though it can).
        - We can allocate memory in Heap using `pointers(malloc)`.
        - If we want to remove pointer them have to destroy the
          allocated memory in Heap.
          Just removing pointer(NULL) will not delete data in Heap.
