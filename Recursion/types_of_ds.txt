=========================
Types of Data Structures
=========================

1. Physical.
2. Logical.


1. How memory should be organized for storing Data. Actually stores in memory
    - Array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        * Static, fixed size.

    - Linked List: [1] => [3] => [4] => [5, 6]
        * Dynamic, size changes.
        * Always created in Heap memory.

    * Can be taken more DS by using combination of those 2 above.


2. Actually used in algorithms, programs, applications. Used by using `Physical DS`
    - Linear
        * Stack
            - LIFO: Last In First Out.
        * Queues
            - FIFO: First In First Out.
    - Non-linear
        * Trees
            - Hierarchy.
        * Graphs
            - Collection of nodes. And links between them.
    - Tabular
        * Hash Table
