Data Structures - the way of organizing the data in memory, during execution of program.

List of Data Structures:
    - Physical DS(how data `arranged` in memory)
        - Arrays
        - Matrices
        - Linked List
     - Logical DS(how data can be `utilized`)
        - Stack
        - Queues
        - Trees
        - Graph
        - Hashing

`Problem Solving` is diff from `Programming`:
    - Programming: can be learned within a few days
        - syntax
    - Problem Solving: lifetime )
        - math
        - math don't have `loops`, it has `recursion`
